## Amazon S3 Hash Prefix
Amazon S3 Hash Prefix helps you scale out read and write operations limits by dynamically injecting a hash prefix for each file stored in S3.

As per described on [S3 Best practices design patterns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance.html) you can increase the read and write performance by using prefixes to create a parallelization factor. Those prefixes however must provide a high level of entropy in order to offer a large number of partitions as detailed in the blog post [Amazon S3 Performance Tips & Tricks + Seattle S3 Hiring Event](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-performance-tips-tricks-seattle-hiring-event/).

Amazon S3 Hash Prefix creates high entropy prefix by hashing the object name and prepending that you the object key.

## Requirements
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/)
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Install
```
make install
```

## Usage
`make dep` install Lambda dependencies

`make install` execute `dep` and deploy the solution

`make sample` create sample files containing datetime in a tmp directory

`make sync` synchronize sample files with landing bucket

`make clean-tmp` cleanup temp directory

`make clean-buckets` cleanup landing and origin buckets

`make clean` execute both `clean-tmp` and `clean-buckets`

`make uninstall` undeploy the solution

## Uninstall
To uninstall the solution you must clean the buckets and then delete stack using [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) console or executing:
```
make clean-buckets
make uninstall
```
